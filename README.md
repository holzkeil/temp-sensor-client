Arduino Temperature Device

Running on a Pro Mini 5V. Is used in rooms to monitor the temperature.
NRF2401L 5V adapter required.

## Features ##

* Measuring the temperature
* Plotting the temperature on a display
* Writing high, low and current values on a display
* Auto scaling the graph
* Adjusting the measurment interval via button
* Writing measurement interval on a display 
* Writing last used interval to EEPROM, reading on startup
* Sending the temperature to another arduino or raspi via nrf2401l
* Indicating sending success on an LED
* Running multiple functions in "parallel" with a Task class
